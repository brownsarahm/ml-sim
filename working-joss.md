# Summary

Machine learning evaluation is of critical importance

ML sim allows for resampling of a provided dataset according to a causal dag or an inferred bn, or generation of completely synthetic data

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$
